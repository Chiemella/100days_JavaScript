let Hey  = 'Hello';

// Values are specifically the smallest unit of informations we have in JavaScript like '1 and Jona' one of the useful cases is to store them in varaibles which means we could reuse them over and over again.

console.log(1+1);
console.log('Jona');
console.log(23)

// Declaring a variable
let firstName = 'Jona'
// firstName is the name of the variable while 'Jona' is the value assigned to the variable

//Varibbales names can not stand with a number

console.log(firstName)

// Assignment
